IRCC also directly supports a multitude of partner organizations such as Global Affairs, the Immigration and Refugee Board and the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) that are undergoing their own changes.The Covid pandemic has a severe impact on immigration, refugee and citizenship Canada's power and ability to process passport applications from Canadian citizens. With travel restrictions easing, unprecedented demand for Canadian passports has led to delays in processing times. Service Canada expects to receive 3.6 million to 4.3 million passport applications in fiscal 2022/2023. Due to increasing demands and the inability to facilitate this at Service Canada locations, IRCC has been working to modernize how they deliver passport services to Canadian Citizens. Passport Digital Services (PDS) Project The Passport Digital Services Project is focused on the development of an online application that will give Canadians the ability to securely access a variety of passport services online such as applications and renewals. Currently, to access passport services, Canadian citizens have to go to a Service Canada location. With the development and implementation of the application within the AWS cloud, IRCC will be able to deliver passport services to Canadians in a more accessible and expedited manner. This online application will connect and communicate with the back end of IRCC's Global Case Management system. À Propos De TEKsystems Nous sommes partenaires dans la transformation.
