After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.Job DescriptionAs Square has grown, so have our sellers – going from businesses with just a few employees, to many (sometimes hundreds or thousands!). Team Management provides business owners and managers with the tools they need to manage their entire team. You will report to the engineering lead and will work on providing permission functionality within Point of Sale and Square Dashboard, plus allowing sellers to track their team's time with time cards.
